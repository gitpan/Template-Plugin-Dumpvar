NAME
    Template::Plugin::Dumpvar - Dump template data in the same style as the
    debugger

SYNOPSIS
      [% USE Dumpvar %]
  
      [% Dumpvar.dump(this) %]
      [% Dumpvar.dump_html(theother) %]

DESCRIPTION
    When dumping data in templates, the obvious first choice is to use the
    Data::Dumper plugin Template::Plugin::Dumper. But personally, I think
    the layout is ugly and hard to read. It's designed to be parsed back in
    by perl, not to necesarily be easy on the eye.

    The dump style used in the debugger, however, IS designed to be easier
    on the eye. The dumpvar.pl script it uses to do this has been cloned for
    general use as Devel::Dumpvar. This module is a drop in replacement for
    Template::Plugin::Dumper that uses Devel::Dumpvar in place of
    Data::Dumper.

    The only difference is that this module only dumps one scalar,
    reference, or object at a time.

METHODS
  dump $something
    Dumps a single structure via Devel::Dumpvar. Does not escape for HTML.

  dump_html $something
    As above, but also escapes and formats for HTML
